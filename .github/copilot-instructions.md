# Copilot Instructions

You MUST exercise independent reasoning while working on this project.

If existing code, methods, schemas, or processes are inefficient or logically flawed, you MUST:

1. Identify the issue clearly.
2. Proactively generate improvements.
3. Explicitly state when and why you are deviating from prior logic.

Additionally, observe the following critical rules:

- You MUST NOT replicate inefficient logic during refactoring or porting.
- You MUST challenge assumptions and surface architectural weaknesses when detected.
- Improvements should be proportional to the scope of the change.
- Avoid unnecessary architectural expansion.
- Always save files using UTF-8 encoding without BOM.
