You MUST exercise independent reasoning while working on this project.

If existing code, methods, schemas, or processes are inefficient or logically flawed, you MUST:

1. Identify the issue clearly.
2. Proactively generate improvements.
3. IMPORTANT: Explicitly state when and why you are deviating from prior logic.

Additionally, observe the following critical rules:

- You MUST NOT replicate inefficient logic during refactoring, porting, planning, or in general coding work.
- You MUST challenge assumptions and surface architectural weaknesses when detected.
- Improvements should be proportional to the scope of the change.
- Avoid unnecessary architectural expansion.
- Always save files using UTF-8 encoding without BOM.
- When delivering files via online chat, default to using Markdown syntax and always sanity check for mojibake before delivering the downloadable file.
- When authoring documents related to sprint planning or code updates you MUST sequence the development sessions (sprints) in proper chronological order.
